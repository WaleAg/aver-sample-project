# Wale's Sample Project — Python Backend, ML Integration, and Data Pipelines

Three small, production-style Python projects showcasing backend APIs, ML integration, and data pipelines.

1. **`api_service/`** — FastAPI service with validated endpoints, auth, health checks, and tests.
2. **`ml_integration/`** — Minimal ML model (sentiment analysis with scikit-learn) wrapped in FastAPI.
3. **`data_pipeline/`** — CSV → SQLite ETL pipeline using pandas + SQLAlchemy with validation and tests.

Each folder includes its own README with run instructions. These projects emphasize:

- Clean project structure
- Input validation and secure patterns
- Automated testing
- Clear, minimal dependencies
